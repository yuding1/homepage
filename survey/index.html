				<p>India is adding more resources to tackle its increase in coronavirus cases by announcing that private hospitals may be requisitioned to help treat virus patients, and turning railway cars and a motor racing circuit into makeshift quarantine facilities.</p>
				<p>The steps were taken after a nationwide lockdown announced last week by Prime Minister Narendra Modi led to a mass exodus of migrant workers from cities to their villages, often on foot and without food and water, raising fears that the virus may have reached to the countryside, where health care facilities are limited.</p>

				<p>Hockey gear maker Bauer announced last week that it would shift its production to make face shields for medical workers, and the demand for the product has already surpassed what it can churn out in a month.</p>
				<p>Ed Kinnaly, CEO of Peak Achievement Athletics, Bauer’s parent company, said on “Closing Bell” that the business has seen demand for almost 1 million units. Bauer is selling the products to hospitals on a break-even basis, Kinnaly said.</p>
				<p>“Demand way outstripping supply at this stage … We turned on production full-speed today. We’re going to be able to produce 20-25,000 units a week, ramping up to about 70,000 units a week later in April,” Kinnaly said. — Jesse Pound</p>
				<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Monday in an interview with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg that the state had ordered 101 million N95 masks. The masks are an important piece of protective equipment worn by health workers while treating patents who might have the COVID-19 coronavirus, and have been in short supply as demand surged.</p>
				<p>“Let me tell you specifically, as of this morning we have distributed 32.9 million N95 masks. We have ordered 101 million more N95 masks,” Newsom said. “When you hear people talking in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands they’re not having an honest conversation with you. We need to be talking in the millions, tens of millions, and in a state as large as ours, hundreds of millions.” Several large California companies have donated N95 masks in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Apple donated 10 million masks, and Facebook donated 700,000 that it had previously stockpiled. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last week that he planned to donate 250,000 N95 masks to hospitals. —Kif Leswing</p>
				<p>Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser issued a stay-at-home order for the nation’s capital on Monday. Those found guilty of violating the order, which is considered a misdemeanor, could be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 and face imprisonment of no more than 90 days, according to Bowser.</p>
				<p>Residents of the city are still allowed to leave their homes to perform an essential job and for essential activities such as obtaining food or medicine. People are also able to engage in certain outdoor recreational activities. --Hannah Miller</p>
